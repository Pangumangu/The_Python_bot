3. **Communication**: Use Web Telegram or Telegram Desktop during tasks and keep notifications on for seamless community engagement.

4. **Assistance**: Reach out for help whenever needed to [Goutham](www.t.me/goutham0) or [Sangeetha](https://t.me/sangeeetaa).

5. **You will not be accessed on basis of points you receive in Cyberstart. So, use hints from Cyberstart and utilize Google to learn more.**

## Your Initial Task Set üìã

1. **Cyberstart.com Intern Phase** üîê
   Begin by completing the intern phase on [cyberstart.com](https://cyberstart.com). This foundational step will build your cybersecurity skills.

Reach out whenever you need guidance. Together, we'll fortify the digital world! üõ°Ô∏è

## Three Approaches to Access the Terminal üñ•Ô∏è

1. **Dual Boot**: Set up a dual boot configuration to enjoy an exact Linux environment.
   - Pros: Replicates a pure Linux experience.
   - Cons: Requires backup precautions and disabling secure boot for Windows 11.

2. **Virtual Machine (Recommended)**: Utilize VMware or VirtualBox to create a virtual Linux machine.
   - Pros: Safe and data loss risk-free.
   - Cons: Demands higher system resources but offers a true Linux environment.

3. **Install WSL or Third-Party Terminal for Windows**: If you want to retain Windows while experimenting with Linux, install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a third-party terminal.
   - Pros: No data risk, suitable for lower-spec systems.
   - Cons: May not offer an exact Linux experience.
